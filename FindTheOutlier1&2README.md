This code will take an input of 3 numbers. It will put them in order and return the number that is furthest from the others. For example, if the inputs are 1, 3, 8 the outlier will be 8 because it has the greatest difference between the numbers.
FindTheOutlier.java uses a for loop to find the outlier while FindTheOutlierTwo.java uses if/else statements producing the same results.
